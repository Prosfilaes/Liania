\emph{A thousand years ago, at the end of a world-shaking war, the artifacts of
Chaos were buried in an ancient dungeon. Above this dungeon, a city was built,
and in its walls magic was bound to prevent any from leaving the city or the
dungeon below. For all the disturbances of the last millennium, the forces
of Chaos have been relatively quiet; will your explorations keep them from
erupting or accidentally unchain them?}

\chapter{Ancestries}

There are many ancestries open to players: dwarves, elves, gnomes, goblins,
halflings, orcs and humans (from \emph{Core Rulebook}); leshy and lizard\-folk (from
\emph{Lost Omens Character Guide}); shoony (from AP \#153 / https://2e.aonprd.com);
steel\-heart (from \emph{Ponyfinder: Second Edition Conversion Guide}); various forms
of beast\-folk (from \emph{Ponyfinder: Untamed Lands}); ne\-djes sphinxes (from \emph{Ponyfinder:
Depths of Everglow}); felsines (from \emph{Felsine}); yroometjis (from
\emph{Files for Everybody: Yroometjis}); mogogols (from
\emph{Amazing Ancestries: The Mogogol}); oya\-poks (from
\emph{Cultures of Celmae: Oyapok 2e}); and ento\-bians (from
\emph{Amazing Ancestries: The Entobian}). (Ratfolk and high fey are works in
progress.)

Humans, halflings, gnomes, goblins and ratfolk are common in Liania.
Orcs, leshy, lizardfolk, shoony, steelheart, nedjes sphinxes, and mogogols are
uncommon; everyone has seen them, but few know one personally. The rest are
rare to the point of being unheard of; if no player plays one, it's possible
they will be non-existent in town.

\section{Steelheart}

The steelheart are a race of mechanical intelligent ponies, numbering about 450.
They were created in town 300 years ago, and the entire race lives here. They
do not reproduce, instead continuously repairing older individuals. Out of the
original 600, 100 have gone missing, and 50 are non-functional and awaiting
repairs. Steelheart with sufficient damage often lack their original memories
after being repaired, but are still considered the same person. (In theory,
this functions as a free raise dead for steelheart; in practice, it will
take equivalent amount of funds to put a PC to the top of the queue. Some
of the non-functional steelheart have been waiting repairs for decades.)

Their creator ascended shortly after their creation, and Fekoro is now a god
worshipped virtually exclusively by the steelheart. Nobody has managed to create
more living constructs like the steelheart, and the steelheart have not been
willing to share any information they have with anyone else.
