\emph{A thousand years ago, at the end of a world-shaking war, the artifacts of Chaos were buried in an ancient dungeon. Above this dungeon, a city was built, and in its walls magic was bound to prevent any from leaving the city or the dungeon below. For all the disturbances of the last millennium, the forces of Chaos have been relatively quiet; will your explorations keep them from erupting or accidentally unchain them?}
